# Deathlink

A celeste mod that allows for people to play with deathlink over CelesteNet!

Ever wanted to die more in Celeste? Well now you can! with friends!
In Deathlink, when one player dies, everyone does! Works with clearing or goldens, and is a lot of fun!
When deathlink is enabled, when a player dies, all other players with the same team number are killed, it it displays who died. You can have as many people on any team as you want :3

\*Requires being connected to the same lobby in CelesteNet
